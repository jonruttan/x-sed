# THE PLATFORM SHIPS THE GATE; BUNDLES DO NOT VENDOR IT.  Three bundles once
# carried a byte-identical copy, and a trap bug had to be fixed in all three
# on the same day -- the case that moved it into tools/lang-kit/.  This file
# only says where the bundle is and which x to ask for the kit.
#
# Set X to point at a particular x; X_LANG_KIT overrides the kit location.
