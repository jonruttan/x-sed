# THE SUITE BOOTS FROM A STATE IMAGE OF THE HARNESS, when the platform can
# write one.  tools/dev/image-build.sh images a child that loaded the harness
# and keys that image on everything it depends on -- the harness, the
# platform's lib/, its engine, and sed/ (the KEY-PATH) -- so an edit to any of
# them rewrites it, and a current one is skipped.  Each spec file then loads
# the image instead of booting the platform from source.
#  THE WRITER IS A CHECKOUT TOOL.  An installed tree has no image-build.sh,
# and a library holding words no image can carry is refused; both say so on
# stderr and the suite boots from source exactly as it did before.
#  AND A PROBE FOR THE FIX, NOT FOR A VERSION.  A platform whose Ansi.install
# moves a REPL printer it does not own takes this bundle's %repl-print away
# when the image loads (x-lang#655) -- a few specs then differ in how a value
# prints, or, worse, none do and the suite passes on the platform's printer.
# The fix carries `Ansi repl-own`; ask the platform for it rather than for a
# version, and boot from source on one that answers no.
#  IMG=0 IS THE CONTROL -- the same suite from source, for when the image is
# the suspect.  One file per process there too, so the boot is the only thing
# that differs between the two runs.
